# AutoLens

AutoLens is an open-source automated lens design framework that uses gradient backpropagation and deep learning techniques to optimize optical systems from scratch. Built on top of the [DeepLens](https://github.com/singer-yang/DeepLens) framework, AutoLens aims to provide a modern, AI-driven approach to optical design.

## News

**[01/21/2025]** Please use the automated lens design examples in the DeepLens repository, as we currently don't have enough resources to maintain this repository. We are working on ways to extend and improve this project.

## About

AutoLens is being developed as open-source lens design software, aiming to provide capabilities similar to commercial tools like Zemax. The project incorporates advanced algorithms including end-to-end lens design and implicit representation techniques, with ongoing updates in the DeepLens framework.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in optical design and AI, please contact Xinge Yang at xinge.yang@kaust.edu.sa.

## Getting Started

### Method 1: Local Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `python autolens.py`

### Method 2: Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/singer-yang/AutoLens/blob/main/autolens.ipynb)
